"[AZARED B. 11-24-2023]Arrived on site, checked in main lobby. Glenn Spohn escorted me to the kitchen. Spoke to the chef, he told me the MarryChef was not working properly and it would stop in the middle of a cooking cycle. Went over to merrychef it was on and at 500F. Did around five cooking cycles to check if it stopped during a cooking cycle. Unit was working properly. Called manufacture but they were closed due to holidays. Did around two more cooking cycles and the error finally appeared it was a overheating error that stopped the cooking cycle. Went into setting tested the magnetron it showed on display 7.3Amps being pulled by the mag. Removed top lid hooked my amp clamp on the magentron it gave me 10.71 Amps being pulled by the magnetron. Tested capacitor rating, got 0.936 farads on it in range of its ratting 0.95farads. Inspected fuses all good. Checked the resistance of the high voltage transformer got 53.5 resistance value in range. Tested heater resistance got 21.1 resistance value. Will have to come back on Monday to contact manufacture and instruct me on the next step.[AZARED B. 11-27-2023]Not at location , called manufacture to tell them what was going on with this merrychef oven. Told them the oven showed an error that it was overheating gave them my amp draws on the magnetron itself 10.71 amps, and 0.2 resistance, manufacture told me that the amp draw was high and that the waveguide could be dirty with debree or grease causing it to overheat. And regarding the amp draw on the magnetron that the magnetron needed to be replaced, the capacitor needed to be replaced and the diode needed to be replaced. Will go to sire to inspect if there is any arcing on the waveguide of the magnetron.[AZARED B. 11-27-2023]On location, called manufacture. Spoke to Paul, Paul told me to inspect waveguide for any debree or arcs. Told Paul there was no arcs and bearly any debree. Told Paul the amp draw on the magnetron was 10.70amps ans that the antenna was turning bright orange color while on cooking cycle. Paul told me I needed to replace the magnetron, the capacitor and the diode. Acquired part numbers from Paul. Ordering parts. Unit still under warranty.[AZARED B. 11-30-2023]Arrived on location with parts in hand, magnetron, capacitor and diode.  Checked in with chef. Went over to merrychef and turned unit off. Removed top lid, back lid and side panels. Removed capacitor and diode. Replaced capacitor and diode. Magentron is connected to exhaust so had to remove whole exhaust and remove the magnetron. Installed new magnetron and put exhaust and side panels together. Turned unit on waited for unit to get up in temperature. Did a 1-minute and 50 second cooking cycle. Merrychef went into E117 overheat error once again. Called manufacture, spoke to Robert. Told Robert what was going on with the unit. I gave him the ohm resistance value of the transformer it was 53.5 ohms. Robert told me the ohms was too low on the transformer that It needs to be at 60ohms of resistance and that's why the magnetron was pulling 10amps. Robert gave me the part number for the high voltage transformer. Ordering part. Unit still under warranty.[AZARED B. 12-05-2023]Arrived on site,checked in with chef. Told him I had a transformer on hand to replace for the merrychef oven. Went over to merrychef oven. Turned unit off and removed side panels and back panel. Replaced the transformer and checked the ohms of resistance on the transformer, got 50.3ohms of resistance. Turned unit on and waited for unit to heat up. Tested a 2minutes cooking cycle and it did not overheat amp draw on magnetron was 9.9amps did another cooking cycle of 2minutes and it gave me the error E117 once again, called manufacture but they were closed. Tested resistance once again and got 51.7 ohms of resistance. Will call manufacture tomorrow to see what they want me to do on the unit.[AZARED B. 12-06-2023]Called Merrychef manufacture, spoke to Dan told Dan the situation with this Merrchef, Dan told me that the error E117 was for the magnetron sensor cutoff. Dan told me I couldn't check the resistance and continuity on it but it would not tell me 100percent if the sensor was bad or good. Dan told me replace the sensor, it clild possibly went prematurely bad.

"[AZARED B. 11-24-2023]Arrived on site, checked in main lobby. Glenn Spohn escorted me to the kitchen. Spoke to the chef, he told me the MarryChef was not working properly and it would stop in the middle of a cooking cycle. Went over to merrychef it was on and at 500F. Did around five cooking cycles to check if it stopped during a cooking cycle. Unit was working properly. Called manufacture but they were closed due to holidays. Did around two more cooking cycles and the error finally appeared it was a overheating error that stopped the cooking cycle. Went into setting tested the magnetron it showed on display 7.3Amps being pulled by the mag. Removed top lid hooked my amp clamp on the magentron it gave me 10.71 Amps being pulled by the magnetron. Tested capacitor rating, got 0.936 farads on it in range of its ratting 0.95farads. Inspected fuses all good. Checked the resistance of the high voltage transformer got 53.5 resistance value in range. Tested heater resistance got 21.1 resistance value. Will have to come back on Monday to contact manufacture and instruct me on the next step.[AZARED B. 11-27-2023]Not at location , called manufacture to tell them what was going on with this merrychef oven. Told them the oven showed an error that it was overheating gave them my amp draws on the magnetron itself 10.71 amps, and 0.2 resistance, manufacture told me that the amp draw was high and that the waveguide could be dirty with debree or grease causing it to overheat. And regarding the amp draw on the magnetron that the magnetron needed to be replaced, the capacitor needed to be replaced and the diode needed to be replaced. Will go to sire to inspect if there is any arcing on the waveguide of the magnetron.[AZARED B. 11-27-2023]On location, called manufacture. Spoke to Paul, Paul told me to inspect waveguide for any debree or arcs. Told Paul there was no arcs and bearly any debree. Told Paul the amp draw on the magnetron was 10.70amps ans that the antenna was turning bright orange color while on cooking cycle. Paul told me I needed to replace the magnetron, the capacitor and the diode. Acquired part numbers from Paul. Ordering parts. Unit still under warranty.[AZARED B. 11-30-2023]Arrived on location with parts in hand, magnetron, capacitor and diode.  Checked in with chef. Went over to merrychef and turned unit off. Removed top lid, back lid and side panels. Removed capacitor and diode. Replaced capacitor and diode. Magentron is connected to exhaust so had to remove whole exhaust and remove the magnetron. Installed new magnetron and put exhaust and side panels together. Turned unit on waited for unit to get up in temperature. Did a 1-minute and 50 second cooking cycle. Merrychef went into E117 overheat error once again. Called manufacture, spoke to Robert. Told Robert what was going on with the unit. I gave him the ohm resistance value of the transformer it was 53.5 ohms.

Robert told me the ohms was too low on the transformer that It needs to be at 60ohms of resistance and that's why the magnetron was pulling 10amps. Robert gave me the part number for the high voltage transformer. Ordering part. Unit still under warranty.[AZARED B. 12-05-2023]Arrived on site,checked in with chef. Told him I had a transformer on hand to replace for the merrychef oven. Went over to merrychef oven. Turned unit off and removed side panels and back panel. Replaced the transformer and checked the ohms of resistance on the transformer, got 50.3ohms of resistance. Turned unit on and waited for unit to heat up. Tested a 2minutes cooking cycle and it did not overheat amp draw on magnetron was 9.9amps did another cooking cycle of 2minutes and it gave me the error E117 once again, called manufacture but they were closed. Tested resistance once again and got 51.7 ohms of resistance. Will call manufacture tomorrow to see what they want me to do on the unit.[AZARED B. 12-06-2023]Called Merrychef manufacture, spoke to Dan told Dan the situation with this Merrchef, Dan told me that the error E117 was for the magnetron sensor cutoff. Dan told me I couldn't check the resistance and continuity on it but it would not tell me 100percent if the sensor was bad or good. Dan told me replace the sensor, it clild possibly went prematurely bad.

"[AZARED B. 11-24-2023]Arrived on site, checked in main lobby. Glenn Spohn escorted me to the kitchen. Spoke to the chef, he told me the MarryChef was not working properly and it would stop in the middle of a cooking cycle. Went over to merrychef it was on and at 500F. Did around five cooking cycles to check if it stopped during a cooking cycle. Unit was working properly. Called manufacture but they were closed due to holidays. Did around two more cooking cycles and the error finally appeared it was a overheating error that stopped the cooking cycle. Went into setting tested the magnetron it showed on display 7.3Amps being pulled by the mag. Removed top lid hooked my amp clamp on the magentron it gave me 10.71 Amps being pulled by the magnetron. Tested capacitor rating, got 0.936 farads on it in range of its ratting 0.95farads. Inspected fuses all good. Checked the resistance of the high voltage transformer got 53.5 resistance value in range. Tested heater resistance got 21.1 resistance value. Will have to come back on Monday to contact manufacture and instruct me on the next step.[AZARED B. 11-27-2023]Not at location , called manufacture to tell them what was going on with this merrychef oven. Told them the oven showed an error that it was overheating gave them my amp draws on the magnetron itself 10.71 amps, and 0.2 resistance, manufacture told me that the amp draw was high and that the waveguide could be dirty with debree or grease causing it to overheat. And regarding the amp draw on the magnetron that the magnetron needed to be replaced, the capacitor needed to be replaced and the diode needed to be replaced. Will go to sire to inspect if there is any arcing on the waveguide of the magnetron.[AZARED B. 11-27-2023]On location, called manufacture. Spoke to Paul, Paul told me to inspect waveguide for any debree or arcs. Told Paul there was no arcs and bearly any debree. Told Paul the amp draw on the magnetron was 10.70amps ans that the antenna was turning bright orange color while on cooking cycle. Paul told me I needed to replace the magnetron, the capacitor and the diode. Acquired part numbers from Paul. Ordering parts. Unit still under warranty.[AZARED B. 11-30-2023]Arrived on location with parts in hand, magnetron, capacitor and diode.  Checked in with chef. Went over to merrychef and turned unit off. Removed top lid, back lid and side panels. Removed capacitor and diode. Replaced capacitor and diode. Magentron is connected to exhaust so had to remove whole exhaust and remove the magnetron. Installed new magnetron and put exhaust and side panels together. Turned unit on waited for unit to get up in temperature. Did a 1-minute and 50 second cooking cycle. Merrychef went into E117 overheat error once again. Called manufacture, spoke to Robert. Told Robert what was going on with the unit. I gave him the ohm resistance value of the transformer it was 53.5 ohms.

Robert told me the ohms was too low on the transformer that It needs to be at 60ohms of resistance and that's why the magnetron was pulling 10amps. Robert gave me the part number for the high voltage transformer. Ordering part. Unit still under warranty.[AZARED B. 12-05-2023]Arrived on site,checked in with chef. Told him I had a transformer on hand to replace for the merrychef oven. Went over to merrychef oven. Turned unit off and removed side panels and back panel. Replaced the transformer and checked the ohms of resistance on the transformer, got 50.3ohms of resistance. Turned unit on and waited for unit to heat up. Tested a 2minutes cooking cycle and it did not overheat amp draw on magnetron was 9.9amps did another cooking cycle of 2minutes and it gave me the error E117 once again, called manufacture but they were closed. Tested resistance once again and got 51.7 ohms of resistance. Will call manufacture tomorrow to see what they want me to do on the unit.[AZARED B. 12-06-2023]Called Merrychef manufacture, spoke to Dan told Dan the situation with this Merrchef, Dan told me that the error E117 was for the magnetron sensor cutoff. Dan told me I couldn't check the resistance and continuity on it but it would not tell me 100percent if the sensor was bad or good. Dan told me replace the sensor, it clild possibly went prematurely bad.

07/19/23:Checked in with chef David and had to walk to the other side of the complex to get in. Once in we walked to the other side of the building to where the unit was. Pulled the unit out and removed the left,right, and top panel. Checked all the fuses and they all checked good. Checked the voltage coming from the outlet and it was good. Made sure the power cord was solid with no cuts as well as made sure it made good connection. Plugged the unit in and nothing popped up on the display. Checked the lower back left board and all the fuses on the board were good. Made sure all connections to the srb board were good and none were burnt or frayed. Checked to make sure the display was properly seated and connected. Checked the transformers and they all ohmed out good. After a long thorough check I noticed the switch mode power was not illuminating like it should. I was getting voltage into it but it was not sending the dc voltage out like it should. Called the manufacturer and went through everything I had checked and he believes that part I found was bad. Unit is covered under warranty and it took a long time because there is no breakdown of the unit and even the manufacturer had a hard time finding info on it because it was relatively new. Will get parts ordered. He did also say that there could be other issues because if it sent wrong voltage anywhere else it could have burnt the other components as well Qty-1-Part#30Z1609(switch mode power)08/16/23: Checked in with chef David NF went to the unit. Put the unit on a cart and moved it aside. Removed the top and right panel. Unwired the bad mode power and removed it from the unit. Placed the new one in and wired it up. Plugged the unit in to test but the unit is still not powering on. Called the manufacturer and talked to Paul and went through the unit with him and found the f1 fuse is blown. He told me unfortunately that when I replace the fuse and it blows again I will have to systematically unplug the bird besides the power and plug everything back on one at a time to find the cause. Will get the fuses ordered  Qty-5-part#30z0456(fuses)
08/29/23: Checked in at location and went to the unit. Put the unit on a cart and rolled it over. Removed the side panel and replaced the blown fuse. Plugged the unit in and the screen turned on and everything started to work. Let the unit power up and tested the unit . Unit is working properly but I did notice that the manufacturer had placed a 14 amp fuse on a 3 amp fuse area. Will try to call them tomorrow and get the correct fuse in
08/30/23:  Allied the manufacturer and talked to Chris and told him that where the 3amp fuse would be there is a 13 amp fuse.","3amp, amp, area, aside, bad, believe, bird, blow, board, breakdown,

"display went dark -unit just Installed.
07/19/23:Checked in with chef David and had to walk to the other side of the complex to get in. Once in we walked to the other side of the building to where the unit was. Pulled the unit out and removed the left,right, and top panel. Checked all the fuses and they all checked good. Checked the voltage coming from the outlet and it was good. Made sure the power cord was solid with no cuts as well as made sure it made good connection. Plugged the unit in and nothing popped up on the display. Checked the lower back left board and all the fuses on the board were good. Made sure all connections to the srb board were good and none were burnt or frayed. Checked to make sure the display was properly seated and connected. Checked the transformers and they all ohmed out good. After a long thorough check I noticed the switch mode power was not illuminating like it should. I was getting voltage into it but it was not sending the dc voltage out like it should. Called the manufacturer and went through everything I had checked and he believes that part I found was bad. Unit is covered under warranty and it took a long time because there is no breakdown of the unit and even the manufacturer had a hard time finding info on it because it was relatively new. Will get parts ordered. He did also say that there could be other issues because if it sent wrong voltage anywhere else it could have burnt the other components as well Qty-1-Part#30Z1609(switch mode power)08/16/23: Checked in with chef David NF went to the unit. Put the unit on a cart and moved it aside. Removed the top and right panel. Unwired the bad mode power and removed it from the unit. Placed the new one in and wired it up. Plugged the unit in to test but the unit is still not powering on. Called the manufacturer and talked to Paul and went through the unit with him and found the f1 fuse is blown. He told me unfortunately that when I replace the fuse and it blows again I will have to systematically unplug the bird besides the power and plug everything back on one at a time to find the cause. Will get the fuses ordered  Qty-5-part#30z0456(fuses)
08/29/23: Checked in at location and went to the unit. Put the unit on a cart and rolled it over. Removed the side panel and replaced the blown fuse. Plugged the unit in and the screen turned on and everything started to work. Let the unit power up and tested the unit . Unit is working properly but I did notice that the manufacturer had placed a 14 amp fuse on a 3 amp fuse area. Will try to call them tomorrow and get the correct fuse in
08/30/23:  Allied the manufacturer and talked to Chris and told him that where the 3amp fuse would be there is a 13 amp fuse.","3amp, amp, area, aside, bad, believe, bird, blow, board, breakdown,
