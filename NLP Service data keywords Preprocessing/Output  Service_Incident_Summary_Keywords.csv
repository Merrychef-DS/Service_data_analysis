Found unit on far right to be unit indicated. Customer stated sometimes it will work fine and sometimes it just stops heating and displays over temp error. They empty unit and then it starts working fine again. Tech inspected, confirmed burner pressure and heated unit. Unit starts to rapidly boil water and once pressure reaches approx 45 PSI unit stops heating but indicates its still heating. Tech opened unit and troubleshot while calling factory. While testing unit found unit started heating properly and temps were accurate when compared with techs surface probe. No issues returned.

First factory attempt call failed after approx 20 minutes holding, second attempt dropped while speaking to tech support, third attempt was a success. Spoke to Jeff in tech support and he advised for customer to not set unit to probe if not using the probe. Tech disconnected the probe and found unit now has time and temperature settings displayed. 

Per Jeff be sure to train customer on operation and make sure unit is operating properly. They will cover the time under warranty.

Tech advised chef and chef took probe to desk drawer and will only plug probe in if they want to use the probe. Tech also pointed out that the lower temp hi lighted in yellow is the probe desired temperature for the food. Chef understands and will use unit as designed.

"11-6-23.  Customer was boiling out fryer and was closing down kitchen. Not hot grease available to troubleshoot pump and motor operation. Said return Wednesday morning.**N/C this date**

11-8-23. Arrived on site and checked filter pump and motor. All wiring looked good. Noticed oil by motor and pump.  Emptied vat and tried pumping oil back in. Found leak where pump shaft meets motor. Seal is leaking by. Will need new pump. Called frymaster and on hold 38 minutes.  Left message for call back and will order pump.

11-9-23. Installed new pump and checked operation.  Motor bogging down still and blew seal again in pump. All lines are clear. Called tech support spoke with Tom. He put me in touch with engineer for frymaster Phil  to tell him what I had going on. Said more than likely wand hose breaking down inside. But said bring motor, pump, wand, and check valves. Will order.

11-21-23.  Installed new pump on filter motor. Motor is running fine and not damaged. Checked valves are working as well. Didnâ€™t replace those.

customer stated unit would go fire and just make a buzzing noise. This buzzing is the failed ingnition buzzer. We started by removing all the cover to the burn chamber and checking all the fittings to ensure that they are snug and proper connections. I did find a loose ground on the ignition module. This could cause a failure to sense flame. To be sure we took pressure readings on the gas valve as well and found it to be at 3.75 which is in acceptable range for the unit. After tightening connections we returned power to the unit and found it to be operating as it should. Informed customer of my findings and what we had done to rectify the issue.

Tech Notes from 1st trip:
""We arrived onsite and spoke with the manager about what was going on. We ohmed out the door switches and found no problem. We called and spoke with tech support, who told us to check the fuses. We found that fuses 1-25a and 1-12.5a need to be replaced. We need to change the fuses before we can do any other diagnosis.""

**Parts came in**
Tech's description from when the parts come in:

Arrived on site and spoke with MoD (Bunty), informed me that unit tripped the breaker and after turning back on it would not heat. Turned unit on, blower and conveyer are working. Turnd off an pulled unit out to check back and access heating element. When i touched the element to remove the wiring the element slid forward toward inside of unit. Removed back panel concealing element and fan and found element broken (picture attached). Called Lincoln, spoke with Rich and informed him of findings. Will order a new element.

"*Remainder from original claim KC-0780756* Arrived on site and checked in. Found pilot would light at main valve but would not open. Checked voltage to main valve found it only getting 13.6 volts and not the 24 that it needed. Pulled flame sensor out and cleaned it put it back in and checked resistance. The flame sensor did not appear to be bad but module would never switch over to main valve to light burners. Removed ignition module and installed new ignition module.

Customer Fault Description: Sparking in cooking chamber
Entitlement: Unit Within Warranty Period
Warranty Coverage Details: Extended Travel approved. OT approved. NDA parts if needed.

Additional Dispatch Notes:
Diagnose and repiar as needed to correct possible rubbing of ran wheel on intake panel. Customer says unit is sparking inside chamber. Please take pictures and email them to ConvothermSVC@welbilt.com

Regards,
Welbilt Case Management

Note: Parts or service charges not covered by manufacturer warranty are the responsibility of the equipment owner. Final determination of warranty status will be based on verified serial number, purchase information, condition of the unit, and on-site assessment by the service repair agent.""

Tech's Notes from the 1st trip:
"" arrived onsite and looked the oven over. I saw nothing out of place. I went into service mode and activated the fan. It did not spark at that point. It decided to go back to cook mode. Once the heat was applied, apparently, it expanded just enough to rub the top of the fan shroud. I removed the covers and inspected the area. The area shows no damage. It must be lightly touching. I went back into service mode, tied the inner covers back, and activated the unit again. No sparks were present with the fan guard out of the way. I contacted Convotherm. They said to determine If it's the blade warped or the motor shaft warped. I can not gain access to the left cover due to restrictions. The machine is shoved against the wall. Welbilt said we would need to do two separate tickets. One to diagnose and repair. The other one was billed to the school for moving the oven and putting it back. It will require two men and 4hrs labor plus the use of a pallet jack. Once the oven is out of the hole, as long as the electrical is long enough, we will be able to diagnose and formulate a plan for repair. We cannot perform the repair until we can get past the access restrictions. I have included the food service director's number. The machine will never be serviceable until it's installed properly.""

Tech's Notes from Trip 2:
""Upon arrival, we inspected the unit and determined we needed a pallet jack to move the unit away from the wall. That way we could access the left side panel. We moved the unit and removed the left side panel and found everything looked good. We then inspected the inside cooking cavity and found where the motor was rubbing the fan shroud. Then loosened the motor mounting brackets and slid the motor as far left and down as far as it would go and then tightened the bolts, which helped a tiny bit but still made contact. Then used two washers to shim the suction panel up where it wouldn't make contact was able to get it to clear the shroud by approximately 1/16th of an inch. I ran the unit where it isn't rubbing anymore, showed the kitchen manager Heather, and then called Convotherm and spoke with tech that states to order the suction panel and return it and then send them the old one. The unit is currently operating properly and is returned to service.""

Tech's Notes from trip 3
""I arrived onsite and started peeling plastic off the suction cover and then had to straighten the cover where it was bent on its edges. Then, after doing so, we installed it and tested where the cover had a good 1/8"" clearance from the fan edges, ran through the heat cycle, and watched to make sure it was operating properly. The unit returned to service.""","['10262023, 10302023, 116th, 1208, 18, 1st, 252, 2707055576, 42066, 4hrs, 97, able, access, activate, agent, anymore, apparently, apply, approve, approximately, area,

Tech's Notes from the 1st trip:
"" arrived onsite and looked the oven over. I saw nothing out of place. I went into service mode and activated the fan. It did not spark at that point. It decided to go back to cook mode. Once the heat was applied, apparently, it expanded just enough to rub the top of the fan shroud. I removed the covers and inspected the area. The area shows no damage. It must be lightly touching. I went back into service mode, tied the inner covers back, and activated the unit again. No sparks were present with the fan guard out of the way. I contacted Convotherm. They said to determine If it's the blade warped or the motor shaft warped. I can not gain access to the left cover due to restrictions. The machine is shoved against the wall. Welbilt said we would need to do two separate tickets. One to diagnose and repair. The other one was billed to the school for moving the oven and putting it back. It will require two men and 4hrs labor plus the use of a pallet jack. Once the oven is out of the hole, as long as the electrical is long enough, we will be able to diagnose and formulate a plan for repair. We cannot perform the repair until we can get past the access restrictions. I have included the food service director's number. The machine will never be serviceable until it's installed properly.""

Tech's Notes from Trip 2:
""Upon arrival, we inspected the unit and determined we needed a pallet jack to move the unit away from the wall. That way we could access the left side panel. We moved the unit and removed the left side panel and found everything looked good. We then inspected the inside cooking cavity and found where the motor was rubbing the fan shroud. Then loosened the motor mounting brackets and slid the motor as far left and down as far as it would go and then tightened the bolts, which helped a tiny bit but still made contact. Then used two washers to shim the suction panel up where it wouldn't make contact was able to get it to clear the shroud by approximately 1/16th of an inch. I ran the unit where it isn't rubbing anymore, showed the kitchen manager Heather, and then called Convotherm and spoke with tech that states to order the suction panel and return it and then send them the old one. The unit is currently operating properly and is returned to service.""

Tech's Notes from trip 3
""I arrived onsite and started peeling plastic off the suction cover and then had to straighten the cover where it was bent on its edges. Then, after doing so, we installed it and tested where the cover had a good 1/8"" clearance from the fan edges, ran through the heat cycle, and watched to make sure it was operating properly. The unit returned to service.""","['10262023, 10302023, 116th, 1208, 18, 1st, 252, 2707055576, 42066, 4hrs, 97, able, access, activate, agent, anymore, apparently, apply, approve, approximately, area,

Tech's Notes from the 1st trip:
"" arrived onsite and looked the oven over. I saw nothing out of place. I went into service mode and activated the fan. It did not spark at that point. It decided to go back to cook mode. Once the heat was applied, apparently, it expanded just enough to rub the top of the fan shroud. I removed the covers and inspected the area. The area shows no damage. It must be lightly touching. I went back into service mode, tied the inner covers back, and activated the unit again. No sparks were present with the fan guard out of the way. I contacted Convotherm. They said to determine If it's the blade warped or the motor shaft warped. I can not gain access to the left cover due to restrictions. The machine is shoved against the wall. Welbilt said we would need to do two separate tickets. One to diagnose and repair. The other one was billed to the school for moving the oven and putting it back. It will require two men and 4hrs labor plus the use of a pallet jack. Once the oven is out of the hole, as long as the electrical is long enough, we will be able to diagnose and formulate a plan for repair. We cannot perform the repair until we can get past the access restrictions. I have included the food service director's number. The machine will never be serviceable until it's installed properly.""

Tech's Notes from Trip 2:
""Upon arrival, we inspected the unit and determined we needed a pallet jack to move the unit away from the wall. That way we could access the left side panel. We moved the unit and removed the left side panel and found everything looked good. We then inspected the inside cooking cavity and found where the motor was rubbing the fan shroud. Then loosened the motor mounting brackets and slid the motor as far left and down as far as it would go and then tightened the bolts, which helped a tiny bit but still made contact. Then used two washers to shim the suction panel up where it wouldn't make contact was able to get it to clear the shroud by approximately 1/16th of an inch. I ran the unit where it isn't rubbing anymore, showed the kitchen manager Heather, and then called Convotherm and spoke with tech that states to order the suction panel and return it and then send them the old one. The unit is currently operating properly and is returned to service.""

Tech's Notes from trip 3
""I arrived onsite and started peeling plastic off the suction cover and then had to straighten the cover where it was bent on its edges. Then, after doing so, we installed it and tested where the cover had a good 1/8"" clearance from the fan edges, ran through the heat cycle, and watched to make sure it was operating properly. The unit returned to service.""","['10262023, 10302023, 116th, 1208, 18, 1st, 252, 2707055576, 42066, 4hrs, 97, able, access, activate, agent, anymore, apparently, apply, approve, approximately, area,
